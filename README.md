# Custom Web HMI Demo - PLCNext Engineer Project

## What is This?

### This Repo

This is a very simple test PLCNext Engineer project with a controller and some
sample variables just to have something to read or write. Also includes some HMI
pages made with the default editor (eHMI) to be able to read/write variables
with the default tools provided, and show that they can coexist with custom HMI
webpages.

### Custom Web HMI Demo Project

This is part of an example project trying to show how you can make webpages with
modern web development tools, upload them to a PLCNext controller (physical or
simulated during development and testing), and have the controller's webserver
serve them.

It is much more involved than a traditional "what you see is what you get" HMI
editor (like the default HMI Pages in PLCNext Engineer, called "eHMI"), but the
possibilities to make much more advanced and customised projects are endless.
You are not limited to a particular framework or set of tools either.

This project is not made or endorsed by Phoenix Contact or PLCNext themslves,
this is just code being shared as a guide/example/tutorial by a user for other
users.

## How to use This

* At the top of the base repo folder in GitHub, use the options in "<> Code" to
download these source files: either clone the repository or download it as .zip.

* Open `custwebhmidemo-plcnexteng.pcwef` with PLCNext Engineer 2023.0.1 (LTS).

* You should have the full PLCNext Engineer project. You can write and start
project to the Simulation or use a physical controller if you want.

* This repo does not include the Custom Web HMI itself, this is just a sample
PLC program/variables and eHMI variables debug to go alongisde it
